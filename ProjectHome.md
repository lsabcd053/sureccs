This is an open Source Project running base on the famous opensource distributed platform---Hadoop. Hadoop use k-way replication to conduct failure-tolerance. K-way replication is easy to implement and have been ever widely used, while we think that it is an uneconomical method because storage space will be largely wasted.Erasure code is a perfect way to conduct efficiency failure-tolerance with high-utilized storage space. So our target is to implement Erasure Code on Hadoop to save the Space.
